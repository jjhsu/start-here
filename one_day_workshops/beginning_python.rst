Learning to Program in Python
=============================

There is no way to realistically learn to program in python within a 
3-hour workshop.  But we hope at least to get you started.

You will be working from your python3 virtual environment you set up in
the previous workshop `Linux Workstation Setup`_.



Tutorials
---------

Take your pick from the following suggestions.  They are all good.


The Official Python 3 Tutorial
******************************

https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html

See how far you get. Start with section 3 - `An Informal Introduction to Python`_

Try to get through sections:

- 4 - `More Control Flow Tools`_
- 5 - `Data Structures`_


Python for You and Me
*********************

https://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

This one is my favorite.  Again just see how far you get.  Skip the sections
on `Installation` and `Using mu editor`.
