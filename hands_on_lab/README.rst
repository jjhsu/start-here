Hands-On Labs - From Console to Code
====================================

The following is a series of self-paced lab exercises designed to introduce new
users to management of AWS resources with code.  Emphasis is on AWS CLI,
CloudFormation, Boto3 the python AWS SDK, and unit-testing of python code.


Working the Labs
----------------

Work on each exercise using all of the following AWS deployment methods.
See `sample solutions`_ for a complete example.

- AWS console
- AWS CLI_
- CloudFormation_
- `Boto3 SDK`_
- `Boto3/Moto Unit Testing`_


Intended Audience
-----------------

- new members of the UCOP AWS Infrastructure Team 
- contributors to any of our UCOPACME projects
- developers and application programmers working in the AWS space
- anyone who wants to learn how to develop AWS infrastructure as code


Estimated Time to Complete
--------------------------

These labs are hard.  If you are new to coding in the AWS space consider it
could require 2 to 3 days to get through all five components of Lab 1.  But
once you have done so, the other Level 1 labs will take much less time.


Prerequisites
-------------

Skills:

- a basic knowledge of AWS
- familiarity with Unix/Linux shell scripting
- experience `programming in python`_

Preparation:

- Create a `GitHub account`_
- Set up `python 3 virtual environment`_
- Install and configure awscli_

Optional preparation:

- Create a `Cloud9 instance`_
- Install and configure aws-shelltools_


Peer Review
-----------

To post your solutions follow the `Contributing to GitHub`_ workflow.  Make a
fork of this repository in your personal GitHub account.  Add a directory for
yourself under ``hands_on_lab/user_solutions/`` and post your code within
sub-directories named for each lab::

  mkdir -p hands_on_lab/user_solutions/$USER/lab1
  cp ~/lab1_code/* hands_on_lab/user_solutions/$USER/lab1

You do not need to submit a AWS Console solution.  We will take your word for
it.  AWS CLI solutions can be shell script or a cut-n-paste of your shell
session.  For CloudFormation solutions, submit a yaml or json template file
along with a script containing launch/delete instructions.  For boto3 and
unit-test solutions, submit an executable python script with usage examples.  

Once you have completed all five parts of a lab, open an issue and pull request in this
GitHub repo to review your solutions: ``[Resolves #<issue_number>] peer review ashley's lab1 solutions``

Peer review will include the following:

- are all five deployment methods complete?
- do all code solutions run without error?
- do unit-tests pass?
- do solutions demonstrate understanding of the various deployment methods?
- are code solutions well organized and well formatted?


Level 1
-------


Lab 1 - S3 Bucket
*****************

- Create an S3 bucket
- Validate bucket creation
- Delete bucket


Lab 2 - IAM User
****************

- Create an IAM user
- Validate user creation
- Delete user


Lab 3 - EC2 Instance
********************

- Launch EC2 instance in the default VPC
- Validate instance is running
- Delete instance


Level 2 - Builds off of Level 1 solutions
-----------------------------------------


Lab 4 - S3 Object in Bucket
***************************

- Create an S3 bucket
- Add an object to the bucket
- Validate bucket is in object
- Delete both object and bucket


Lab 5 - IAM User in Group
*************************

- Create IAM user
- Create IAM Group
- Add the user to the group
- Validate user is in group
- Delete both user and group


Lab 6 - SSH to EC2 Instance
***************************

- Create or upload an SSH key pair into EC2 service
- Create a EC2 SecurityGroup in default VPC with rule allowing ssh access
- Launch an EC2 instance your SSH key pair and SecurityGroup as properties
- Log into your instance with ssh
- Delete your EC2 instance, SSH key pair and SecurityGroup

AWS CLI

CloudFormation

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/sample-templates-services-us-west-2.html

Boto3 SDK
*********

For boto3 solutions we recommend you start out by using service clients_ rather
than resources_.  Clients provide a low-level interface to AWS whose methods map
close to 1:1 with AWS CLI.

Boto3/Moto Unit Testing
***********************

We recommend starting with pytest and moto for your unit-test labs.
